title: A week of cooking
excerpt: |
  We've been on holiday in the Northumbrian coast for the past ten days. I
  volunteered to be chef for the week. I really enjoy cooking, but between work
  and family constraints, I don't get the chance so often. I thought it would
  be fun to write up the week's cooking in the same style as Nigel Slater's
  Kitchen Diaries.
---
This week is a family holiday in the Northumbrian coast. I volunteered to be
chef for the week. I really enjoy cooking but between work and family
constraints I rarely get the opportunity, so I've been looking forward to the
opportunity. There have been six of us here all week -- the maternal
grandparents (affectionately known as Mogie and Baba), Annabel, the two kids
and me. In addition, there have been various extra friends and family visiting
through the week.

We prefer the kids to eat with us, but if they're particularly tired (no nap
days for Emily!) or we wind up eating particularly late, they eat separately
and head to bed. Usually, it's leftovers from the previous day, but there's
always the fall-back option of pasta 'blobs' (ravioli or tortellini).

## Preparation

Since we're in a small, relatively remote, village, I figured that being
prepared was a good plan. I brainstormed a few recipe ideas, mostly repeats of
things I've cooked in the past 6 months, along with a couple of 'simple' meals
so I could skive off:

* Roast chicken for Sunday lunch, with the usual accoutrements of potatoes and
  veggies.

* A chilli con carne, using one of the kits from the Cool Chilli Company.

* Spinach and Ricotta Cannelloni. This started out as lasagne, but I fancied
  trying something a bit different, and I haven't made this for years.

* Fish pie. I'd made one recently for the same audience and it went down pretty
  well, so I thought I'd repeat it, varying a couple of things.

* Haggis, neeps and tatties. Always a good fall-back meal.

* Spaghetti bolognese.

* Boiled Ham in coca cola, with parsnip, potato and porcini gratin. I cooked
  this a few months back for a family Sunday dinner and they went together
  pretty well.

* Pumpkin risotto, mostly because we had pumpkins for carving (we're a bit
  behind schedule with celebrations this year -- I'm sure we'll be letting off
  fireworks in a week or two!) and it's a good way to use up the spare flesh.

With that, a couple of meals out and some leftovers, chances are we'll have
enough to keep us going for the time. Everyone seemed happy with the selection,
so it was just a case of placing an order online with Tesco for the ingredients
and having them delivered to the house shortly after we were scheduled to
arrive.

This worked remarkably well. It was pretty straightforward to turn the ideas
into approximate recipes, then create a shopping list for the ingredients. And
the delivery turned up just after we'd arrived and unpacked, without any crazy
substitutions.

## Friday, 1st November

> Arriving; a new kitchen; Joe, Charlie and Pete staying; kids eat past blobs;
> we have tagliatelle bolognese.

After a long and noisy car journey down -- Emily didn't sleep, so there was a
chorus of her screeching "You're not helping!" for much of the journey until I
took over driving instead of "entertaining" -- we were looking for something
simple for dinner. Joe & Charlie were driving up from Cornwall, too, so their
arrival time was a bit fluid.

After unpacking the Tesco delivery, we found some pasta 'blobs' for the kids,
and made them an early dinner. Meanwhile, I started making up a tagliatelle
bolognese. This was, as it turns out, the hallmark of the week, and what I
enjoyed most about the cooking. Two particular things:

* I took my time. I wasn't rushing anything, prepared things in advance, and
  felt generally entirely in control of the cooking process. It helps that
  nobody was that fussed about when we ate dinner -- crisps and dips could
  always fill a gap -- so even if things took longer, it wasn't a big deal.

* I didn't strictly follow a recipe. I'd done a little research in advance, so
  I knew the relative proportions I was aiming towards, and I'm familiar enough
  with each of the processes that I could wing it. This was the most freeing
  aspect, and what destressed it most. Instead of worrying about exactly
  following a set of rules, I could just feel my way towards the right thing,
  noting texture, taste, colour, and responding to it.

In terms of the bolognese sauce, I completely made it up. Which makes writing
it up a week later a bit tricky. :) I had a kilogram of beef mince to cook, so
I started out by browning it in batches in a couple of frying pans. I often
forget that over-filling a frying pan when you're browning meat is a daft thing
to do, but this time I experimented with different batch sizes to see what
works well.

In a large, deep, pan, I sweated some chopped carrots, celery and onion in
garlic-infused olive oil. (I seem to have used most of the bottle of this stuff
through the week; it's delicious!) I was aiming to keep the temperature such
that the onions softened and went translucent, instead of caramelising. I'm not
really sure why you choose to do one or t'other, but it seemed like the right
thing to do.

After about ten minutes or so, the veggies were looking just nice. I added in
some dried oregano (I couldn't find any fresh!), and stirred that in for a few
seconds. I'm sure that frying dried herbs for a few seconds is a good thing to
do -- it certainly smells delicious -- so I tend to add them at this stage.
Then I mixed in the browned mince and a 'squeeze' (probably closer to half the
tube!) of tomato paste. Everything got mixed up well, then I added two tins of
chopped tomatoes, and a little water (washing out the tins of tomatoes). There
was an open bottle of red wine, so I chucked in a splash of that for good
measure. :) While nobody was looking, I chucked in a tiny splash of my current
hot sauce.

Once it was back up to the boil, I covered it with a lid, turned it down to a
light simmer and left it 'til the kids were in bed and everyone arrived. After
that, it was just a case of checking the seasoning, boiling up some fresh egg
tagliatelle, and sticking a garlic bread in the oven. When the tagliatelle was
ready and drained, I tossed it in a splash of the garlic-infused olive oil for
good measure.

Everyone seemed to enjoy it. There were a couple of comments about a lovely
piquant taste, which I blame the hot sauce for. See, in small doses, it can
work well. As usual, I didn't even consider pudding. Mogie rescued that with a
delicious fruit salad.

## Saturday, 2nd November

> Joe, Charlie and Pete are here; fish and chips for tea!

It turns out that the fish and chip shop opposite was closing for the season
tonight. So today was our last chance for fish and chips? Who could resist?

The kids ate up the remainders of last night's tagliatelle bolognese, and even
seemed to like it. All of it disappeared anyway. :)

I was quite keen on cod -- as usual since it's by far my favourite white fish
-- but beggars can't be choosers on the last night of the season, so it was all
about the haddock. It was a good haddock, though, with a delicious batter and
moreish mushy peas. Chips I can happily skip, though with a bit of salt and
vinegar, they can be OK.

Still, that's me off the hook tonight. I'd hoped to save this wild card for
later in the week, but that's OK.

## Sunday, 3rd November

> Joe & Charlie here for lunch before heading off; Pete heads off in the
> morning. The roast chicken Sunday lunch.

This is a meal I've done he components of a number of times before, and I've
done almost exactly the same meal recently. Better still, I'm armed with a
large vat of home made chicken stock that comes from the remains of barbecued
beer can chickens, so the stock has a delicious smokey aroma. I can't lose. :)

The menu is a simple roast chicken, maple-roast parsnips, roast citrus and
fennel carrots, roast potatoes and gravy.

I was most worried about the chicken. I hadn't really considered what to do
with it (other than roast it). I was comfortable with winging it, though. I
wanted oil and salt on the outside to make sure it crisped up nicely, and I
wanted something shoved up its bottom to make sure it stayed moist. So I
massaged some garlic-infused olive oil into the skin, along with a good grind
of salt and pepper. As for the enema, I sliced up a lemon and a carrot, and
shoved that in. That was enough.

The chicken was of a weight that it got to sit in the oven for about 2 hours.
In the meantime, I prepared the rest.

The potatoes are nice and simple. Peel and chop them into lumps that are
approximately the same size (this way they all cook about the same speed). I
always find this to be easier said than done, particularly when Nigella is in
the back of my head with a diagram showing me how I should cut them so
everybody gets a traditionally shaped wedge. Honestly, it doesn't matter *that*
much; some just wind up even crispier and crunchier than others.

The parsnips are straightforward, too. I'm aiming for "splinters". Not as thin
as matchsticks, but not very chunky. Again, this is tricky, particularly
because parsnips vary so wildly in girth. Typically, after peeling, I tend to
half or third them lengthwise, to get consistently long chunks. Then I'll
halve, quarter, sixth or ninth the chunks vertically, depending on their girth.

Any way, I wind up with a pile of thin(nish) shards of parsnip. I dump them in
a roasting dish, add some salt and pepper (just a rough grind for now), then
add a good glug of oil (Nigella's original recipe called for sunflower oil, but
I rarely have any kicking around, so I usually substitute for olive oil), and a
good glug of maple syrup.

I'm happy to let these sit for a while together. I don't think that there's any
particular marination going on, but equally there's no harm in preparing in
advance so they're ready to go in the oven.

Likewise with the carrots. Prepare them in much the same way (though perhaps a
little thicker -- I note that recipes and shops refer to carrots as 'batons'
rather than 'shards' -- I suspect this is a reflection on the relative cooking
time) as the parsnips. Chuck them in a suitable roasting dish and add some
olive oil. This time, I used garlic-infused olive oil. (In fact, through the
week, I almost finished an entire bottle of the stuff because it was so
delicious!) One of the secrets to this recipe, though, is fennel seeds.

I frequently get confused by various seed-based flavourings. When I first had
this dish, I could have sworn it was caraway seeds. And I'm sure there are a
bunch of herbs/spices that will produce the same effect. What you're looking
for is an aniseed taste to complement the carrots.

So add some fennel seeds to taste. And some salt & pepper, as usual. They're
ready to roast when the time is right.

Finally, the potatoes. There has been something of a family competition about
roast potatoes. Once it was announced by my mum that my brother in law, Jim,
made the best ever roast potatoes. This became a challenge. I'm traditionally a
devotee of Delia, but for Christmas dinner over the past few years, Nigella
(particularly the first chapter of 'Feast') has become my cooking deity.

Her roast potato recipe is fairly straightforward, and is focused around
getting that crisp outside on the potato. You par-boil the potatoes first, then
bash them to hell in the pan so that the outsides go fluffy, then coat them in
semolina. Only then do you roast them in the duck fat in the oven.

Recently, while watching crap television, I osmosed the idea that there's an
easier way. After par-boiling the potatoes, drain them, stick them back in the
pan and put a tea towel over the pan. (This is similar to the technique for
producing lovely, fluffy, rice.) It turns out that this worked phenomenally
well (and I repeated the experiment several times over the week). I reasoned
that putting a tea towel over the hot pan was able to retain the heat, while
dispersing the moisture, meaning that the outside of the potatoes dried out
nicely.

With everything prepared, it was just a case of sticking the sides in the oven
at the appropriate time. The maple-roast parsnips and the potatoes just needed
cooking for the right amount of time which, fortunately, is a fairly wide
window. The carrots had some 'breakfast' juice (the first recipe I followed
asked for orange juice, but having tried breakfast juice now -- usually a
mixture of orange and grapefruit -- it's definitely nicer) to be added. It
should be added after the carrots have achieved some caramelisation, but before
they get dry and shrivelled. They then spend long enough in the oven that the
juice turns into a glaze. Today I had to transfer them to a pan and fry for a
bit until that happened.

Once the chicken was done, all that remained was the gravy. For a while I was
worrying about how to create a nice gravy. Then I remembered the chicken stock
in the fridge. It was destined for the risotto later on the week, but there was
a lot of it and I'm sure I could spare some.

I used to *really* fear making a roux. When I was a kid, I was taught that you
thickened things with a bit of corn flour suspended in water. Anything else was
really risky and bound to wind up with lumps. The Roux method truly is
terrifying, because at each checkpoint, you do wind up with lumps. And it's
impossible to believe that it'll work out. (Sometimes it doesn't.)

But I'm getting the hang of it. Equal amounts of butter and plain flour. The
quantities of each depend on how much sauce you want or how thick you want it.
Melt the butter in a pan, let it bubble for a bit. Mix in the flour and combine
it well. Make sure the mixture fries for a couple of minutes -- it helps cook
the flour. At this stage, it won't necessarily combine so well and it'll seem a
bit like wet sand. That's OK.

Now chuck in some of the liquid. It'll look ridiculously lumpy for a bit, then
after continuous mixing will turn into a thick glue. Repeat the process of
adding liquid and stirring until it looks too thick. You know you're done when
you keep stirring it and the lumps have gone and it looks about as thick as you
want it.

In this particular instance, I swapped the butter for the oil/fat mixture that
has exuded from the chicken while it was cooking. First of all, shift the bird
to a chopping board to let it rest, covering it with foil to keep in the
moisture and heat. Now stick the roasting dish back on a burner and start
scraping away at the caramelised bits. This can be a tricky thing ... if you've
genuinely burnt stuff, then it'll taste bad, but if you've got it right, that
will be lovely, juicy caramelised fonds and totally worthy of a gravy.

Chuck in the flour, trying not to burn it to the bottom of the pan, mix
everything up and cook it for a bit.

I should have been clearer. At this point, I had another pan with some of my
delicious stock simmering away. I made a slight mistake. Having seen the stock
in its cold form -- a jelly -- I assumed it was too thick and gluteneous from
the bones of the chicken and that it needed watering down to turn into usable
stock. This turned out to be rubbish and meant my finished gravy was a bit
tasteless until I boiled off the water...

So, I added the stock to the roux until I had a nice consistency of gravy. I
got my taste-tester to affirm that it was a bit watery, and boiled it off for a
bit (and added a little Worcester Sauce, just for good measure).

That was pretty much it. I convinced Annabel to carve the turkey, because she
has a degree in biology and a natural affinity towards dissection, and served
it all up.

It's somewhat gratifying to have somebody, who's had a few roast chicken
dinners, to come up to you at the end of the meal and say, "that's the best
Sunday lunch I've ever had." :-D

## Monday, 4th November

> Back to just the core family. Today was Haggis, neeps & tatties with the
> whisky sauce.

Originally, today was supposed to involve pumpkin carving, to allow for risotto
in the evening. This turned out to be a theme for most of the week. While I was
out writing, I got a message saying the popular vote was for haggis, neeps and
tatties for dinner. Nice and easy. This was one of my "throwaway" meals for the
week, in that it required very little effort.

The usual tack is to do mashed potatoes. However, since I had duck fat still
sitting in a roasting dish from the previous day's cooking, it seemed crazy to
miss the opportunity. Roast potatoes again. I was tempted to mash the roast
potatoes afterwards to get a crunchy mash, but I was talked out of that. Next
time. So, potatoes were the same as yesterday.

I used the neep as an example of why I keep my knives sharp and in good
condition. I took an equivalent knife from the supply in the kitchen and tried
to chop the neep. It was ... hard work. In comparison, using my own knife, it
was like slicing through butter. I love my knives.

I boiled the chopped up neep for a while (about 20 minutes or so) until it was
soft enough to mash. I mashed it with a chunk of butter and plenty of salt &
pepper. I'd have preferred to use white pepper, but I wasn't at home so black
pepper did OK.

For the haggis itself, we had two of them. One was a proper haggis, and one was
vegetarian. I wrapped each in foil, put in a dish, added a little water as a
bath, and cooked in the oven for about 45 minutes. When they were done, I
removed the foil and their outer wrapping (plastic, sadly, not a sheep's
stomach, in both cases), and dumped them into a dish. I was using a single
large dish to serve things, so I formed each haggis into opposing quadrants.
(If I ever get really into food dye, I should think about creating something
similar in the shape of the saltire.)

So the end dish was served up with the two haggis in opposite quadrants, the
neeps in one corner and the roast potatoes in the remaining space. All that was
left was some sauce.

There was still loads of rich, delicious, chicken gravy left over from the
previous night. I had a cunning idea. How about using that as a basis for this
whisky sauce I hadn't yet thought through? So I reheated and tasted the chicken
gravy. Yeah, it was still tasty. And then I added some Isle of Jura Whisky. Oh,
my, that was good. And a little more, let it bubble off a bit. Yeah, that's
what I was after.

I must admit, I was really pleased with this meal. The individual components
were good (that whisky sauce was lucky but delicious!) and they worked well
together. Again, well received, which is as much as a cook can ask. I got a lot
of practice accepting complements this week.

## Tuesday, 5th November

> Just the core family; today was fish pie.

Ah, fish pie. This, or seafood chowder seems to be my piece de resistance,
certainly amongst one half of the family. I really do love fish pie. The
combination of delicious smoky fish with eggs, the piquant taste of capers (and
cornichons, as this recipe calls for), a white sauce, and mashed potatoes. To
be fair, it's got the same component parts as fish, chips & tartare sauce, but
it's a touch more elegant, right?

For a long time, I've followed a single recipe for fish pie diligently. It's
from a Scottish chef, Sue Lawrence, and it's pretty good. It's got the capers,
and it's got the fish (obviously), and it's got eggs, and it's got mash on top.
Lots of the important ingredients.

Last time I made it, though, I was away from home and didn't have my trusty
recipe book. A bit of Googling helped me figure out the approximate proportions
(this is what always worries me about improvising -- am I going to get the
ratios right?), and inspired me to add cornichons, too. This time I went a step
further and added white wine, too.

Invariably, when I make fish pie, I think, "cod". Because I love the flakiness
and taste of cod. It's a thing for me. However, inevitably, my wife, Annabel,
goes shopping for the ingredients. And cod is terribly expensive, and Annabel
doesn't like smoked fish much, so we wind up with a compromise. I've learned to
live with these things. Putting cod in a fish pie is probably a waste, anyway.

Today's fish pie has three packs of "fish pie mix" (salmon, smoked haddock and
unsmoked haddock, I think) to chuck into the mix.

In an effort to be prepared, I make the mash at lunchtime, before heading out
for an afternoon walk. It's pretty straightforward. Peel about a kilogram of
potatoes and chop them up such that the boil efficiently. Stick them in a pan
of cold, salted, water, cover, bring to the boil and let them simmer away
until nice and soft (about 20-25 minutes in my case). Drain well and put back
in the pan with a tea towel over them for a few minutes.

I had a bit of an epiphany about putting tea towels over cooked food this week.
It's to help them dry out a bit (I kind of knew that). But it works by
retaining more of the heat, while still allowing the moisture to escape
into/through the tea towel. Cunning.

After they'd rested for a few minutes (probably about 10 minutes -- I was
chatting with John and eating lunch while all this was happening), I put in a
dollop of butter (about 50g), two tablespoons of creme fraiche and some salt &
pepper. I mashed it until I had a nice, smooth, consistency, then stirred in
about 200g of cheese (a mixture of cheddar and parmesan).

After recovering it with the tea towel, I left it and went out for an afternoon
stroll that turned into an 11 mile walk with a pint or two as a reward. :)

In the evening, I start by poaching the fish. The idea, as I understand it, it
to get all the components so they're cooked, and after the final assembly, it's
just a case of reheating and browning. In a 180 degree oven, I poach the fish
in about half a litre of whole milk, and a sploosh (about 200ml, which was what
was left in the bottle) of white wine. To that, I've added a small handful of
peppercorns and bay leaves. (If you're serving to, say, customers, you might
want to count the peppercorns and bay leaves in and out so you don't
accidentally blow someone's head off.)

That sat in the oven for about 10 minutes, until the fish was cooked. I removed
the fish from the poaching liquid and flaked it into the oven dish I'd be
cooking and serving it in. Then I strained the poaching liquid -- which was now
a warm broth of milk, wine and fishiness -- into a jug to use for the white
sauce. This is a good time to count the left over bay leaves and peppercorns,
just to make sure none escaped with the fish!

To the fish, I added a generous helping of capers -- I put in about 3 heaped
teaspoons -- about 6 cornichons chopped so they're roughly the same size as the
capers, and 3 boiled eggs, sliced. I didn't bother stirring them in at this
stage, as I don't want to break up the fish too much. I like to get big flakes
of fish in the finished pie, rather than an unidentifiable mush.

The last process involved is making up a white sauce. As I've said before, the
roux method always terrifies me, but it rarely lets me down. So I melted 50g of
butter in a pan, let it bubble away for a minute, then add 50g of flour. Next
time I'll remember to check my ratios of flour to liquid, as the end sauce
wound up a little runnier than I wanted (probably because of the additional
liquid from the white wine I snuck in).

Mix it all around, and let the flour cook for a couple of minutes, then start
gradually adding the poaching liquid and stirring as usual until I've got a
nice white sauce. I tasted and seasoned the sauce with salt and pepper at this
point. Then insisted that Annabel taste it, too, since I thought it was
absolutely delicious!

Just the final assembly now. I poured the white sauce into the oven dish with
the fish, and mixed it around so the ingredients were well covered with sauce.
Since the fish is already cooked, I was safe to have another taste, just to be
sure it was all OK. Then dollop the potato on top, first of all smoothing it
out to seal in the filling, then fluffing it up so that it crisps and browns
nicely in the oven. Working with cold mash made this slightly trickier. If I'm
preparing the mash in advance again next time, I might try and heat it a little
before applying it as a topping.

The end result was put in the oven until it browned (or, more accurately, until
the kids fell asleep) which was about 40 minutes, and was served with a few
asparagus spears we found in the fridge.

## Wednesday, 6th November

Meal out at lunchtime, then snacking for dinner.

## Thursday, 7th November

> Large family lunch out at Beadnell Towers with Judy, Alex, Kathy & Chris;
> Kathy & Chris stay over; I made pumpkin risotto for supper.

## Friday, 8th November

> Joe & Charlie return; and it's chilli con carne for dinner.

## Saturday, 9th November

> Pancakes for second breakfast; spinach and ricotta canelonni for dinner.

Breakfasts are always a bit awkward because we all live to different schedules.
Malcolm and Emily are usually up and active by 06:30. Depending on how noisy
they are -- the living room is upstairs, the bedrooms downstairs -- running
around the place, the rest of the family will be up around 8 or so.

The kids have 'first breakfast' when they get up. So far this week, it's bee a
(relatively) healthy Organix oat bar, but we'd run out so this morning I
resorted to shortbread biscuits. (I hadn't had coffee, I wasn't thinking
straight.)

When everyone else was up, there was a quick second breakfast of cereal, then
John & Charlie headed out along the beach to search for more jet, having found
a few gems the previous day.

### Buttermilk Pancakes

Meanwhile, I got stuck into making some pancakes. Annabel had bought some
buttermilk when they were last at the shops, so I was aiming for buttermilk
pancakes. We were missing the bicarbonate of soda, but I was assured that just
made them taste of bicarbonate of soda anyway. The recipe worked out as:

* 300ml Buttermilk
* 150g plain flour
* 2 medium eggs
* a pinch of salt
* 50g melted butter

I hadn't appreciated how simple pancakes could be! I mixed the salt and the
flour together, melted the butter in a pan and cracked a couple of eggs into a
cup, whisking them a bit to break up the yolks. Then I combined all the
ingredients -- mixing the melted butter into the flour first, just to make sure
I took the heat out it a bit and didn't accidentally scramble the eggs.

I took to heart the two things I've read before about making buttermilk
pancakes: don't worry about lumps (I'd hazard a guess it's much like a roux, in
that the lumps are the flour trapped in fat), and don't stir too much because
it strengthens the glutens in the flour.

Once I'd made the batter, I left it alone for a while and nipped off for a
shower, waiting for the beachcombers to return.

I stuck half a dozen rashers of bacon under the grill, and fired up two frying
pans to cook the pancakes, getting four pancakes to each pan. It's always fun
trying to figure out quantities and densities in the pan, and cooking time and
suchlike. My pancakes were ... variable -- from blacked to barely browned --
but they all looked cooked, at least.

The pancakes were served naked, along with a pile of bacon in the middle of the
table. People chose to pair the pancakes with bacon and maple syrup, or
blueberries and creme fraiche. Either way, they were well received.

### Spinach and Ricotta cannelloni

After breakfast, I got stuck straight into preparing for dinner. I was
following the mantra of taking my time and enjoying it, and there were a couple
of processes here I wasn't 100% comfortable with.

I'm sure the last time I made cannelloni, I blanched lasagne sheets so they
could be curved to make the cannelloni tubes. This time it was much simpler: it
turns out that Tesco sell ready made tubes. Winning. I spent a bit of time
lining up the tubes in various ovenproof dishes to see what I could use to cook
it. The biggest dish fitted eighteen tubes, and I had twenty four. That's OK, I
reasoned, I could make a separate one for the kids!

For the spinach and ricotta filling, I started out by melting 50g of butter, a
splash of garlic-infused olive oil, about 4 small cloves of garlic, diced, and
some grated nutmeg. I love the tiny wee graters that you get in the jars of
whole nutmeg! Once that was melted and bubbling, I started adding the spinach.
There was 600g of spinach to get through -- three bags! -- so I chucked in a
bag at a time, and let it wilt a bit so I had enough room for the next bag.

Once all the spinach was looking mushy, I chucked it into a bowl, including the
liquid and left it aside.

The next thing to think about was the tomato sauce. Following the lead from the
bolognese sauce, I started by sweating a diced carrot, a couple of chopped
celery sticks and half of a huge red onion. Again, I was aiming to sweat,
rather than fry, it, keeping the onion translucent rather than caramelising it.

To that I again added a pile of dried oregano, and some tomato paste, combined
them and let it sizzle for a few minutes. Finally, I dumped in two tins of plum
tomatoes and, after tasting it, a spoonful of demerara sugar. (Sometimes, as in
this case, the tomato sauce tastes a bit sharp. Adding some sugar takes the
edge off nicely.) I chopped up the plum tomatoes a bit with a spoon, then left
it to simmer for 20 minutes or so. At some point, I realised I had a pile of
basil stalks and chucked them in for good measure.

For some reason, I decided I wanted a smooth tomato sauce. I'm really not sure
why, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. There's a blender in the
kitchen. Well, it's a smoothie maker, but the principle -- the spinning blades
-- is the same. :) After I'd left the ragu simmering for twenty minutes, I
dumped it in the smoothie maker and blended it for a bit.

The result was still a little coarse for what I had in my head. I had this
great idea of sieving the result. So I painstakingly sieved the lot. What I
really needed was a **insert name of mesh cooking thing here** but I didn't have
one, so it was a case of trying to push the sauce through a metal sieve with a
spatula. It took a while, but the result looks smooth and tastes awesome (to
me, at least). It slightly worried me that the leftover bits tasted good, too,
but they definitely were stringy (hello celery) or bitty (hello tomato seeds).

I did vaguely worry about it being a bit thin -- maybe the stringy bits are
what provides the body. We shall see how that turns out.

While the tomato sauce was preparing, I continued with the spinach and ricotta
filling. It's pretty straightforward. Squeeze the liquid out of the spinach, a
handful at a time, keeping the juice from it (because it's buttery, garlicky,
spinach-ey deliciousness). Chop up the spinach finely. (I wish I'd paid more
attention to this as a wondered why I'd bother chopping this mushy spinach into
tiny bits. As it turns out, I suspect it would have made it so much easier to
fill the cannelloni.) Then combine with the ricotta cheese and add back the
liquid. Give it a good mix, then taste and season.

This is where it gets interesting. How do I fill twenty four tubes with this
mixture? I contemplated it for a bit -- no point in rushing into a solution
that turns out to be a disaster! Eventually, I came up with the following:

* A Ziploc bag with the spinach and ricotta filling could have the bottom
  corner snipped off and turned into a piping bag; and

* I found a large ramekin-like container that meant I could stand up most of
  the tubes in at once, so they were vertical.

This worked reasonably well. I'd pipe some filling into each tube, then use a
knife to make sure it was properly pushed down (I didn't really want air bubble
filling half the cannelloni!). Next time, I'll be more careful about snipping
the outlet to be smaller than the tubes, and I'll make sure the spinach is
chopped finely enough to pass through it easily.

Still, it worked, and I wound up with all but three tubes filled up.

Then I tried the last three tubes loose. Next time, that's how I'll do it.
Stick the piping bag in one end, hold it vaguely horizontally, and pipe in some
of the mixture. You can see if filling it, it's pretty straightforward and it's
easy to control. So, live and learn.

Now we've got a tomato sauce as a base, and twenty four cannelloni tubes stuffed
with spinach and ricotta mixture. Time to combine!

The target oven dishes get a layer of the tomato sauce. I think the large dish
got too much tomato sauce -- it wound up drowning the cannelloni -- but we shall
see. Then I popped in the filled cannelloni. In the large dish, it wound up
looking like ... well, I thought it looked like the backbone of a fish. Annabel
thought it looked like something out of Alien. The leftovers that didn't fit
wound up in the smaller dish.

And that, unfortunately, is how I left it, on the work surface, waiting for the
finishing touches, while I disappeared off for a walk.

When I came back -- albeit four hours later -- the cannelloni had started to
dry, and curl, and separate. Which doesn't look so good. So I decided to cover
it in the white sauce quickly to prevent it from drying any further.

The white sauce wound up as a fairly standard cheese sauce. There was 50 grams
each of butter and flour. As usual, I had a mild panic about them combining and
burning. Then I kept adding full cream milk until the consistency seemed about
right. I'd say it was about 500ml or so of milk, but it felt so good to just
add milk 'til it seemed right, instead of worrying about adding a particular
amount, then worrying about whether it was right or not.

After letting that bubble for a bit -- mostly because I hadn't prepared in
advance -- I added about 200g of grated cheese (a mixture of cheddar and gran
padano), and a little grated nutmeg. After they'd melted in, I tasted and added
salt/pepper.

Finally, I poured the white sauce over the two dishes. There was enough to
cover both, completely. That's not entirely what I was aiming for -- I'd been
hoping a bit of pasta would poke through and get crispy -- but we shall see.
Finally, I topped it with some mozzarella cheese and a bit more pepper. Now
it's just a case of chucking it in the oven, letting it brown, making a salad
and hoping for the best!

I feel like I've spent most of the day cooking. Or, at least, that cooking has
been the more rewarding, least stressful part of the day. When I'm in this
'mode', I really enjoy cooking alone, and I get really frustrated when people
offer to help or, much, much worse still, I wind up with an audience. When I'm
trying a new technique -- say piping filling in to cannelloni tubes -- and there
are two kids asking what I'm doing, asking if they can have a taste, asking if
they can help, the bubble bursts a bit. It turns into a very different
activity.

I may have been a bit unsubtly grumpy about this...

## Sunday, 10th November

Today was an ... interesting day. I was keen to bury myself in the kitchen because I was having a bad day and I really wanted to keep out of the road of other people, so I didn't spoil the atmosphere.
