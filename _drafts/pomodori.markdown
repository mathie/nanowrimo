title: Pomodoro wish list
---
I go in and out of phases of using The Pomodoro Technique to maintain some
focus during the day. When I do use it, it works well. When I find myself
slipping out of the habit, it's usually because I'm mentally resisting doing
something (for whatever reason).

But wait, step back a second, what *is* The Pomodoro Technique anyway? It's a
system developed by Francesco Cirillo to help manage your time and maintain
focus. The basic outline is pretty simple:

1. Pick the most important task that deserves your undivided attention right
   now. It can be a big task, or a small one, the size isn't important.

2. Set a timer for 25 minutes and commit to yourself that you will spend the
   next 25 minutes working on this task without interruption. If it's a small
   task, you might complete it in the 25 minute period. If it's a big task,
   well, at least you're 25 minutes closer to completing it.

3. Until the timer rings, keep your focus on that task. If there's an
   interruption, write it down, forget about it and carry on with what you were
   doing.

4. When the timer rings, put a check next to the task to say you've
   successfully completed a Pomodoro on the task.

5. Get up out your chair and go for a wander. Take a 5 minute break.

6. Reassess your current list of priorities (particularly if an interruption
   came in), pick the most important thing that now deserves your attention and
   repeat the processes.

7. Every few Pomodoros, take a proper break. Go out for a walk, get some fresh
   air, have a natter with colleagues. Spend about 30 minutes away from the
   computer.

It's pretty straightforward and doesn't require any tools, just writing
materials and a timer. The author of The Pomodoro Technique specifically
recommends a mechanical kitchen timer because it makes a real ticking sound
when it's counting down. (And he sells them, but to be fair he was recommending
them for a long time before that!)

Being a geek, I'm naturally interested in using technology to solve problems.
After all, if Ruby on Rails Web 2.0 Single Site JavaScript applications are my
hammer, then *everything* starts to look like a world wide web of thumbs. And
I'm clearly not the only one. There are dozens of applications for the Mac,
web, iPhone and iPad that allow you to set a 25 minute countdown timer. Some of
them look prettier than others. Some have extra whiz-bang features. (Very few
use the word 'Pomodoro' as I suspect somebody is keen on protecting the name
from infringement.)

However, I haven't found any that track and reflect on the most interesting
thing: the data that the system can allow us to collect.

## Additional Tools

Step back another second. While the basic Pomodoro Technique is simple, there
are a few extra bits we can put in place to give ourselves rich data on our
efficiency and patterns.

### Activity Inventory Sheet

This is a collection of all the things that you need to do. It's your Trusted
System in Getting Things Done, your Master Task List in What Matters Most. It's
your external brain with respect to all the things you currently know you need
to do. Personally, I use OmniFocus as my GTD-like trusted system here, because
it offers plenty of flexibility in organisation and helps me with recall.

However you do it, this is the pool of all the tasks you need to complete. It's
almost certainly going to be long, will always keep growing rather than
shrinking, and may well be extremely daunting, which doesn't make it a terribly
useful thing to be staring at all day.

If you have additional information about particular activities -- say they must
be deferred until a particular date, must be completed to a deadline, or you
have an estimate of how long they're going to take -- then you can record that
information here. It's not *necessary* to record such information, though, so
don't feel the need to create artificial deadlines for items just because
there's a deadline column.

### To Do Today

This is the list of things that you're committing to spending time on today.
The key word is 'commitment', and that's how your daily list is different from
a regular to do list. By selecting a number of activities to move to it, you are
committing to spending time on those activities. You are also committing to
*not* spending time on the other activities you didn't transfer across.

In my morning planning session, I'll typically select a couple of high level
goals for the day, usually based on the calendar. For example, on a normal
Wednesday in November (not that there have been any so far!), my goals would
look like:

> #### Goals
>
> * Make progress on Project `B` for client `L`.
>
> * Write my NaNoWriMo quota for the day.
>
> * Go rock climbing.

Based on the shape of the day, and how many Pomodoro I've completed on other,
similar, days, I then estimate how many Pomodoro I'm going to successfully
complete today. (The number of Pomodoros that I can successfully complete in a
single day is entirely context sensitive. Sometimes, I can fire through 12 of
them if I get a super-focused, completely uninterrupted, day in the office.
Other times, if my day is full of meetings, or I'm relaxing with the family,
I'll fit in just one or two.)

Armed with all this information, I can then select the most important tasks
from my activity inventory sheet that I could be working on today. At this
point, if I am selecting an activity where I haven't estimated the number of
Pomodoros it will take to complete the task, I'll do that now. The estimation
is useful here, along with the estimation of how many Pomodoros you reckon
you'll achieve today, because it gives you an idea of how many tasks you can
successfully commit to today.

If I find that I have tasks that are estimated to take more Pomodoros than I
typically fit into a day, that's a sign I want to be breaking it down into more
fine-grained tasks.

So then I'll wind up with an activity list along the lines of:

> ### Activities
>
> Estimated Pomodoro for today: 8
>
> 1. Automatically open Site -> Buyer invoices when a sale is completed. (2/4)
>
> 2. Research SagePay Token system to see if there's a simple way we can
>    integrate with it. (1)
>
> 3. Investigate this Airbrake error. (1)
>
> 4. Write up some notes on my use of the Pomodoro technique for NaNoWriMo. (3)
>
> 5. Catch up with business banking in FreeAgent. (1)

The one thing I've illustrated here that I haven't mentioned before is that
sometimes I'll deliberately split a task over multiple days, just for balance.
That's the case with activity 1 here, where I estimate there are 4 Pomodoro
remaining to complete it, but I'm only intending to commit to doing two of them
today before moving on. The activities are written in what I currently consider
to be priority order, though the priorities are reassessed at the start of each
Pomodoro, so can change.

The final section on my to do today sheet is just a header, written in red ink:

> ### Unplanned and Urgent

This is where I'll record activities that I work on through the course of the
day that I hadn't planned to at the start of the day. This can include external
interruptions like client requests that require a rapid response, or fire
fighting production issues. It can also include internal interruptions -- often
things that didn't jump from my trusted system to my to do today list that
should have done so, or plain procrastination.

With that, I've already completed my first Pomodoro of the day -- a planning
Pomodoro -- so I can reward myself with a wander to the kitchen for a coffee
and a five minute break. I deliberately use a Pomodoro for planning my day for
another reason: time boxing. I've got a deadline to work to for processing my
inboxes, reviewing my trusted system and planning my day, so I don't waste half
the day doing it!

## Capture during the day

As I'm working through the day, the Pomodoro Technique has me capture some
additional information about what's happened during the day in order to reflect
back, learn and improve. I have:

* The number of Pomodoros I've successfully completed for an activity. This is
  represented on my to do today list as a thick green tick next to the activity
  for each Pomodoro I've completed.

* Whether that activity has been finished. I represent this on my to do list by
  scoring through the activity with a ruler-drawn black line. This is somewhat
  satisfying. :)

* The number of interruptions sustained during an activity. These fall into two
  categories:

  * Internal interruptions, where my brain goes off on a tangent, or I suddenly
    thing of something else I need to be doing. Most often, it's going off on a
    tangent to the activity I'm supposed to be focusing on just now, usually
    when I catch a piece of unrelated code in the corner of my eye, go 'WTF,
    seriously?!' and want to fix it. I just note down the cause of the
    interruption in the inbox of my trusted system, put a little mark against
    the activity I'm working on to indicate an internal interruption, and carry
    on, hopefully having not lost too much flow.

  * External interruptions, where something else grabs my attention. Usually
    it's my phone, but sometimes it's the pinging sound of my email distracting
    me enough that I can't help having a look (switch email off!), or a
    colleague popping across for a chat. If I can, I'll just note the cause of
    the interruption in my trusted system's inbox. If it's urgent and needs
    dealing with today, I'll stick it on the "unplanned and urgent" section of
    my to do today list. I'll make a different mark next to the activity on my
    to do today list to indicate an external interruption, then carry on.

* The number of abandoned Pomodoros. Sometimes, having suffered an
  interruption, it's enough to have lost focus on what you're doing. That makes
  the Pomodoro void. I note these down next to the task with a thick red 'X',
  as well as recording the correct interruption mark, then take a five minute
  break as I usually would at the end of the Pomodoro. And then start again.

There's a decent amount of information captured there, which allows me to
reflect at the end of the day whether it's been a productive day, or if there
are specific things I could do to improve my productivity/focus tomorrow
(turning off email on my phone, too, for example!). It also allows me to
reflect on the accuracy of my estimates, and whether I would like to feed that
back into future estimates.

There are a couple of other pieces of information I'd like to capture:

* How long I actually spend on a single Pomodoro, rather than the 25 minutes
  I'm supposed to spend on it. I quite often stretch out Pomodoros for longer
  than the proscribed time -- "I'll just finish this wee bit off before I
  break", which then stretches out for another 25 minutes. I'd like to see
  whether there's some useful optimisation in the length of Pomodoros for me,
  personally.

* When I take breaks, and how long I break for. This can be a dangerous thing.
  If I'm having a distractable day, breaks will often become the places where I
  procrastinate before getting on with the next Pomodoro. Having spent four
  minutes making a coffee, I still have a minute to go, so I check out Digg
  Reader. 20 minutes later, well after the break alarm has gone, I'm still
  sitting reading RSS feeds.

* Patterns of Pomodoros through the day. Do I always wind up voiding the
  Pomodoro immediately after lunch due to an internal interruption? What times
  of the day do I most successfully crunch through the Pomodoros? (If I had to
  guess, for me, it's first thing in the morning and last thing in the working
  day, with a lull in the middle. I'd like data to back that up.)

And more, I'm sure.

## Reflection

At the tail end of the day -- often before I head home from the office, or
sometimes at home if I've felt the desire to fit in one last Pomodoro before
running for the train -- I reflect on the progress I've made that day. I total
up the number of successfully completed Pomodoros, the number of failed ones,
and the internal/external interruptions, recording these elsewhere.

I update my trusted system based on what I've completed today, adjusting
estimated time remaining on activities I have better information about, ticking
off the things I've completed, and adjusting future actions. If I've still got
time in my reflection Pomodoro, I'll either review the data I'm starting to
collect about the system, see if there are any interesting patterns, or I'll
get a head start on the next day's planning.

## At last he gets to the point

And that's the point. While on the surface, it's just a 25 minute timer, there
are some subtleties to the system that, followed completely, give you feedback
to improving. That's what seems to be missing from all the iOS applications
I've looked at which claim to implement the Pomodoro Technique. What I want is
an application that captures all the information on the To Do Today sheet,
store it, and allow me to develop some inferences from it.

As I think I've demonstrated already, this application doesn't replace my
trusted system, it complements it. It is a view on today, and the ability to
provide a feedback loop on my productivity.

I see the application as having three distinct modes:

* Planning.

* Doing.

* Pausing.

* Reflecting.

### Planning

The planning mode is where we start the day. Initially, I will have to enter an
estimated number of Pomodoros that I intend to achieve today. Over time,
hopefully the system can get smarter about suggesting a number, based on
historical information and what the calendar looks like for today, but it can't
know everything, so it can always be overridden.

It's not strictly Pomodoro, but I like the idea of having a couple of headline
'goals' for the day. I often use this to remind myself that there's a sense of
balance to the day, and that there's more to life than Client Y's Project X
(though Client Y often tries to convince me otherwise!). So the next (optional)
stage is to enter a couple of goals.

Next is the meat of the planning session: committing to doing a certain
selection of activities for the day. Ideally, what I'd like to do is
automatically pull this information from a particular view in another trusted
system (e.g. my Today perspective in OmniFocus), but for now it can be manual
data entry. The system will capture:

* A description of the activity, along with an optional URL link to more
  details (an email, a page in Evernote, whatever will help you get quick
  access to more context if necessary). Perhaps the system could maintain a
  history of descriptions, and allow the user to auto complete based on them.
  That way frequently recurring descriptions (e.g. 'Write my NaNoWriMo quota
  for today') could be quickly filled in, along with the previous estimate. It
  would also allow the activities to be linked, for more fine-grained
  reflection on specific activities (e.g. 'You always estimate two Pomodoros
  for writing 1,700 words, yet always spend 3 Pomodoros completing it!').

* An estimated number of Pomodoros for it to be completed and, optionally, if I
  don't intend to complete it today, the estimated number of Pomodoros I intend
  to spend on it today.

The application can keep track of a total estimate for activities today,
berating you for committing to doing activities without leaving slack if you
often wind up with urgent/unplanned activities, for example. You can rearrange
the activities so that they're in order of importance -- that way, starting a
new Pomodoro is simply a case of choosing the top-most item from the list.

Once you're happy with the list for the day, hit "commit", and you'll
automatically start your first Pomodoro, taking you to the 'Doing' mode.

### Doing

The 'Doing' phase has three simple tasks:

* describing what you're supposed to be focusing on right now (the
  description);

* providing feedback on how much time you've got left in the Pomodoro; and

* allowing you to record interruptions & voided Pomodoros.

Once the Pomodoro is complete, the actions (allowing you to record
interruptions) are replaced with a single button to 'end' the Pomodoro. This
immediately takes you into 'Pausing' mode.

#### Interruptions

Efficiently recording interruptions is a key component of doing. You want to be
able to record enough information that is meaningful when you come back to it,
but get it done quickly enough that you don't lose focus on what you were
already doing. When an interruption comes in, there are a few pieces of
information which will come in handy:

* whether the interruption is internal or external;

* a description of any activity required as a result of the interruption;

* whether the interruption needs to be dealt with today (unplanned/urgent); and

* if the interruption needs to be scheduled in to today, an estimated number of
  Pomodoros required to complete it.

If it's an interruption that doesn't require any action, there are no
activities to associate with it; just record and carry on.

If there's an activity resulting from the interruption, but it doesn't need to
be dealt with today, then it's destined for your activity sheet or other
trusted system. Keep a note of it for the end of the day, but keep it out of
sight for now.

If there's a resulting activity which needs to be completed today, then it
requires an estimate. Next time we get around to the mini planning session
before starting the next Pomodoro, it's part of that list, and we can reflect
on its priority relative to the rest of the activities on the list.

#### Voiding a Pomodoro

Now I think about it, a voided Pomodoro is just a special case of an
interruption. It's an interruption (internal or external) where we just lose
focus. So perhaps the sheet that pops up to capture interruptions has two
completion buttons: 'carry on' and 'void'.

### Pausing

The 'pausing' phase is pretty much identical to the 'Doing' mode, except
there's no description for the current activity (or at least the description
for the current activity is 'go make coffee!'). There are still actions to
record interruptions and to void a break. In addition, there's a mechanism to
switch break length -- short break or long break -- where the times for those
are defined by your preferences, but default to five minutes and 30 minutes.

Similarly to the 'Doing' phase, when the countdown is complete, the actions
will switch to a single button to 'end' the break. At this point, it will
transition to a simplified planning phase.

### Simplified Planning

While the full blown planning phase should be unnecessary before each Pomodoro,
it is still necessary to reflect before starting a new Pomodoro, "what is the
most important thing I could be working on right now?" The simplified planning
phase gives you that opportunity. It displays the list of activities you've
committed to today, plus any unplanned/urgent activities that have cropped up,
along with the estimated number of Pomodoros for them. You have the opportunity
to tick off activities that you've completed, and rearrange the remaining list
into priority order.

When you hit "Commit", then your next Pomodoro will start, with the top item on
the list. My feeling is that automatically choosing the top item on the list,
but giving you the opportunity to rearrange the list will help you think more
deliberately about what the most important thing to work on really is.

The other option at this stage is to hit "end day", which will take us on to
the reflection phase.

### Reflection

This is a summary of the day: completed Pomodoros, completed activities,
activities that need to be moved back into your trusted system, with updated
estimates, and a summary of interruptions, maybe with some pithy analysis which
always turns out to have a positive message. But the key output is to get:

* A list of activities that need to be updated in your trusted system; and

* feedback on your progress today.

## That's All Folks

That's it. This is the replacement I'm imagining to my pen and paper solution.
There is something nice about using pen and paper to track all this stuff, but
I also rather like technology, collecting data, and analysing it. I'm hoping
that the analysis will lead to positive feedback.

I'm imagining it as an iPad application that sits with me at my desk all day,
with my iPad plugged into the power, and always on. It's simple to interact
with, not distracting, and looks elegant. Of course, I could also imagine it as
an iPhone application in a similar manner. I'm sure this information could be
successfully represented in the iPhone form factor.

While synchronisation amongst devices (iPhone and iPad, perhaps) might seem
useful (e.g. I could plan my day on the iPhone on the way into the office, then
transfer that to the iPad on my desk to execute on it), that definitely doesn't
seem like a minimum viable feature. Still, it might be worth making sure I use
the Core Data APIs to store information, and not shoot myself in the foot if it
comes to iCloud synchronisation.

Of course, this idea might only apply to me. I wonder if it fits in with
anybody else's workflow?
