title: Getting Shit Done (mid-2013 edition)
---
I've been a (bad) student of the Getting Things Done&tm; philosophy for a long
time now. I still remember when I first read the original book. It was
September 2005, when I spent a week on the Greek island of Naxos with my
(not-quite, at that point) wife and father-in-law. I remember getting very
cross at the introduction, but resolving to stick with it.

Since then, I've fallen off the horse and gotten back on more often than I can
remember. That's more of a reflection of me than the system; when I follow it,
I'm more productive. I'm currently, mostly, on the horse and I've got a
specific system I work with. It largely involved three tools:

* [OmniFocus]() as my 'trusted system' which contains all the stuff I want to
  do.

* [EverNote]() which has a few roles. One is as a tickler file, one is as a
  general searchable store of material, and the final is as a daily journal.

* Pen and paper. Yeah, I know. How quaint. If it's any consolation, it's lots
  of different coloured pens, and sometimes it's Moleskine jotters.

So. How do I put together these tools in such a way that I know what I would
like to be doing *right now*? Well, I've been reading a pile of different
things over the years, about flow, about software development methodologies,
and about getting stuff done. What I've wound up with is something of a mix of
these tools. I hope it's an effective blend of these methodologies, rather than
me picking and choosing what I like from each, losing the whole. I'd appreciate
your feedback.

## Trusted System

OmniFocus acts as my trusted system. Anything I need to do, or would like to do
at some point, or currently think I might like to do, goes in there. I keep it
running all the time on my laptop, and any time I think of something else I
need to do, or have an idea about something, I hit `ctrl-alt-space`, write it
down and carry on. Whatever I've captured winds up in my inbox.

Similarly, when I'm dealing with other inboxes (email, Twitter messages, GitHub
notifications, SMS messages, bits of paper, iPhone photos, Evernote inbox,
voicemails, my morning pages, my brain, oh dear, I have too many inboxes!), I
have a very simple system:

* If it can be dealt with in a couple of minutes (in other words, the
  processing overhead would be a significant portion of the overall task time),
  then I just deal with it.

* Otherwise, it goes into my OmniFocus inbox -- and gets removed from the other
  inbox -- so that it can be triaged and dealt with appropriately. For emails,
  I'll either process them on my laptop, where the clip-o-tron neatly gets them
  into OmniFocus, or I'll process them on my iPhone, forwarding anything that
  needs dealing with to the OmniFocus sync server. Text messages get
  copy-and-pasted, photos can be forwarded, too.

So every non-trivial task that I do winds up in my trusted system. When I'm out
and about, I can easily capture tasks with my iPhone or iPad. In principle, I
could talk to Siri and my reminders would be consumed by OmniFocus, but I've
still to convince Siri to understand my Scottish accent, especially after a
beer or two.

Capture is sorted. Once I've captured everything new, the next stage is to sort
things in to projects and actionable items that take that project towards
completion.

### Projects

So, what is a project? A project in terms of Getting Things Done is a smaller
thing than you might think. It's just something where there's more than one
atomic action needed to take it to completion. "Atomic" is perhaps too strong,
but it's definitely something that feels indivisible, and that you can do in a
single session. Personally, I find it's better to split a project into really
small tasks, than it is to have a single 'task' that lingers for days.

The trouble is that I end up with a lot of projects. After all, "change my
bike's rear tyre" is, strictly speaking, a project. Before I can actually
perform the repair, I need to buy a new inner tube, and I need to get the inner
tube and tools into the office, where my poor bike with its flat back tyre is
languishing. Then, and only then, can I actually change the tyre on my bike
(and then cycle home instead of taking the bus!)

### Context

That brings up the idea of context. It's an important concern in Getting Things
Done, but I personally find it less significant. Most of the resources I need
to do the things I need to do are "my computer", and "my computer with Internet
access". There are others -- being out and about, making phone calls, being at
home or being in the office -- but I'm currently quite relaxed about contexts.
If I need a scarce resource to complete a task, that's the context. Otherwise,
I tend to categorise it as being work ('Office') or personal ('Anywhere',
because I occasionally do personal things in my 'lunch hour', too).

### OMG IT'S FULL OF PROJECTS!!!1!

Back to projects. I'm not so bad at realising that something on my list as a
single action really has multiple actions and, therefore, is a project.
However, I'm sometimes resistant to admitting it, and making the change,
because it generates yet another project. And this system generates a lot of
projects. I mean a *lot* of projects.

This is daunting, and it's one of the reasons I've fallen off the GTD wagon in
the past. With the sheer breadth of projects, there's a fear to turning
something into yet another project. So I tend to wind up with a bunch of single
action lists, which are really projects in disguise. Which, in turn means that
I don't get to tick off -- complete -- things until multiple steps are
completed, which in turn is demoralising, which creates
fear/disinterest/resentment in the system in the first place.

In the past, I've made use of groups in OmniFocus to group projects by role,
which makes things a little more manageable. I've got a top level group for
each of:

* 'Work' where I put all the projects that are directly related to work. In
  there, I've a group for each client, and a group for internal, which is
  mostly admin.

* 'Family' where household projects, stuff to do with the kids, shopping, gift
  ideas, potential days out, car maintenance, etc, goes.

* 'Me', which is all the stuff to do with me, personally, or stuff that doesn't
  really fit in elsewhere. This includes regular maintenance ('get a haircut'),
  personal development and super secret projects.

* 'Maintenance', which is maintenance of the system itself. This includes daily
  chores for keeping my trusted system in check, weekly reviews, etc.

That helps a bit; I tend to work in relatively isolated modes -- work, home or
'me' time -- but I still wind up with dozens of projects under each "role",
which still creates some fear in dealing with the todo list effectively.

I'm also slightly uneasy about personal development and super secret projects
being dumped under personal, especially since I rarely devote any "me" time to
actually getting on with my todo list. Personal development is, technically,
important to work, too, and hopefully one or two of the super secret projects
will be worth devoting work time to, too. The trouble is it's tricky to admit
that when client work == money...

In the past, I've had trouble with the distinction between 'Me' and 'Family'
projects, too; to which role does, "install XMBC on the Raspberry PI" belong?
I'm not sure the rest of the family really cares about being able to stream
random stuff to the TV, so maybe it is a personal thing. But equally, we have a
regular discussion about enabling music through the house, and this would help
solve that. So I've considered merging these roles. But the sheer number of
projects that would wind up in a single role as a result is ... daunting.

I also have this nasty habit of having bright ideas. I have these ideas
(usually in the shower in the morning) and decide they are the best thing ever,
and that I must work on this idea right now (sometimes I have the patience to
finish showering and getting dressed first). I'll generate projects and a pile
of next actions, planning how I'm going to take over the world.

And then I'll get started building out the boilerplate Rails app that I'll use
to prototype it. By the time I've -- yet again -- put together all the pieces
needed by a responsible Rails application, usually experimenting with something
new and shiny while I'm at it, I've lost steam (or I'm interrupted by what I
should actually be doing at the time). And the project languishes. But it's
still there in my trusted system, reminding me that I haven't completed it.

It all boils down to: too many projects! So what can I do to feel comfortable
and honest about capturing things as projects, with atomically completable next
actions, while managing the sheer volume of projects?

## The Pivot

For collaborating with colleagues and clients, I've been using
[Pivotal Tracker]() for years. Its process is based around the Pivotal Way,
which is a roughly Scrum-like Agile methodology. There are two key components
from Pivotal Tracker I want to make use of:

* the story; and

* the backlog.

Let's take the story first.

### The Story

A story is a single unit of deliverable work, preferably one that delivers
business value. It feels to me like this maps well to a 'project' in Getting
Things Done. (Certainly, when I'm using Tracker for client collaboration, every
new story I work on becomes a project in OmniFocus). The individual tasks that
Tracker allows you to track on a story map onto the actions of the GTD project.

Stories tend to have a description. One of the Agile ways is to headline the
description of a story in the Connextra format:

> As a `role`,
> I would like to `do some particular task`
> in order to `deliver some business value`.

It's slightly tricky to formulate some projects into this sort of format. e.g:

> As `me`,
> I would like to `get a haircut every couple of months`,
> in order to `refrain from looking like my evolutionary ancestors`.

The Getting Things Done system has a different take on it. Each project should
have a vision. How it **feels** to have completed the project. Some kind of
visualisation of what the completed project will mean. (This kind of thinking
suits our brains, apparently.)

The thing I've taken from this is that my projects like to have a description
of some kind. I'm currently trialling the 'vision' version of them in the notes
of the project, and making sure the notes from the project are visible each
time I'm looking at a project.

### The Backlog

The backlog is the collection of stories. It's split into three parts in
Pivotal Tracker:

* *Current*, which contains the stories that you're actively working on and
  have committed to achieving in the current sprint. (A sprint is a fixed unit
  of time in Agile methodologies -- usually a week or two -- and is part of the
  larger planning/doing/reflecting cycle. As an aside, I really dislike the
  word choice, because it implies an anaerobic, unsustainable, challenging
  thing, but then expects you to repeat it every cycle...)

* *Backlog*, which is a roughly ordered list of projects that you haven't
  committed to doing in this current cycle of work, but that you're planning to
  tackle next, once the current stuff is done. Generally speaking, these
  projects are already pretty well defined (a vision, a reasonable set of next
  actions, and an idea of how long the project will take to complete). Barring
  any changes in priority, these are the projects that I'll be working on next
  when the stuff in current is complete.

* *Icebox*, which is a dumping ground for everything else. It's the things that
  haven't yet been fleshed out, haven't been committed to, the crazy ideas, the
  Someday/Maybes.

This is a good way to keep things manageable. There's space for all the whacky
ideas that I might want to consider in the future (icebox). There's a small,
manageable, set of projects that I am committing to working on in the next week
(or two), and there's a place to keep the projects that are somewhere in
between, as they're fleshed out, prioritised and committed to.

### Applying to OmniFocus

So, let's try applying this to my OmniFocus trusted system. For each top level
role (or, in the case of work, for each client), I have the projects I'm
actively working on at the top level of that group, then I have a sub-group for
Backlog, and a single action list for the icebox. So I wind up with a structure
along the lines of:

    Personal
    -> Fix my bike's back tyre
       -> ...
    -> Research and contemplate buying a new iPad
       -> ...
    -> Single Actions
       -> ...
    -> Backlog
       -> Set up a NAS at home
          -> ...
       -> Write a scraper for the current price of villas at Center Parcs
          -> ...
       -> Single Actions
          -> ...
    -> Icebox
       -> ...

So the top level has the projects that I'm currently actively working on
(fixing the back tyre on my bike -- which has turned into an extensive project,
mostly revolving around trying to figure out where Emily has hidden my tyre
levers! -- and contemplating buyig a new iPad). At the end of the current list
is a single action list that contains things which are genuinely single
actions. Order is important here, which I'll cover later on, but I consider
pushing projects to completion to be more important than tidying up single
actions.

Then there's the backlog. It's similar to the top level current list, just
containing projects that I haven't yet committed to doing in the next couple of
weeks.

And finally, there's the Icebox. In OmniFocus, I use a single action list to
represent it -- because there's usually no dependencies amongst the items --
and I mark it as paused, so none of the items in it show up as available. I can
still chuck projects in there, whether I've fleshed them out or not.

### Focus

There are distinct advantages to this layout. Mostly, it's about focus. When
doing my daily planning and review sessions, I do the collection and processing
as usual, but when I'm planning my priorities for the day, I only need to
review the 'current' projects for whatever role I'm fulfilling that day. It's a
much smaller scope. On the flip side, I don't ever contemplate keeping
something *out* of my trusted system because I don't want to deal with it just
now.

### Scheduled Projects

I haven't yet worked out a good solution to scheduled projects. For example, I
have a recurring project each quarter to submit Rubaidh's VAT return. It's
definitely a project, in that it involved multiple discrete steps. Where does
it go? When it's time to complete the return, it should be in current. But when
it's not time to complete the return, it's not a priority at all and so should
stay in the icebox, really. However, with the icebox being a paused project,
even items with a deferred start date don't show up as available.

I've taken to compromising. Scheduled projects get moved into the backlog group
when they're soon to be current, and get moved into current when they actually
become available. Then, when they're completed, the recurred project gets
chucked back in the icebox. It's not perfect, but it'll do for now.

## Weekly review

The weekly review is the time to think more strategically, to review what I'm
currently working on, the backlog, and the icebox for each role. As well as
examining each project to verify that it has an achievable next action, I'm
reflecting on priorities. Am I currently working on the most important thing?
Should my priorities be adjusted? Having completed a bunch of 'current'
projects, what am I going to move up from the backlog? What's going to move
from the icebox to the backlog and be fleshed out more? What's going to be
relegated back to the icebox, or dropped entirely?

After getting fully 'in' to zero -- reviewing all my inboxes, checking that
nothing has slipped through the cracks (usually receipts I need to enter for
business expenses, and other bits of paper, as it turns out) -- I review all
the projects that are 'current' or in the backlog. For each of these projects,
I'm usually asking myself:

* Is this project still in the right place relative to my current priorities?

* Does a project from the backlog need to be promoted to current? Or is it a
  project in current that no longer has the same sense of importance, and can
  be relegated back down to the backlog? If it can be relegated down to the
  backlog, then I can just move it there and forget about it for the rest of
  the review.

If the project is still current, then I ask myself:

* Is the next action really the next thing I can be doing to move this project
  forward? Is it too big? Can I split it up? Do the subsequent actions
  currently seem reasonable?

* If the project has stalled (i.e. I haven't made any progress on it since the
  last review), why? Is there a hidden next action? Am I blocked on something
  external? Is it not really a priority? Or am I avoiding it for some reason?
  (And if so, how can I help myself to get back on track?)

For the most part, I can constrain the detailed review to the current and
backlog items. I scan the icebox for each role for two reasons:

* Checking to see if there's anything that would like to be promoted to the
  backlog -- something I intend to get done in a couple of weeks' time -- or
  all the way up to current (it's getting attention in the next week). At this
  point, I then need to treat it in the same way as I've outlined above.

* Checking for things that are no longer relevant. Since relevancy is a
  subjective idea, and my subjective opinions vary over time, I've recently
  started capturing items that I remove from the icebox on a page in Evernote.
  It's a catalogue of ideas that I once thought were important, then discarded
  as not being a priority. The hope is, that way, I don't keep having the same
  ideas, and keep failing to execute on them. I can either note:

  * this is a bad idea, and I remember why, because I've written it down; or

  * this idea keeps reoccurring. Perhaps there's something to it after all?

That way, I'm regularly reviewing my crazy ideas to see that they're still
relevant, but still not important.

Then there's all this nonsense about being bold and creative proscribed in
David Allen's book. I tend to be neither bold, nor creative, when it's demanded
of me. These things happen more spontaneously...

## Limits

There's a notion from the Kanban software development methodology (which I
assume comes from 'Level the production' in Toyota's original Kanban
implementation). It's about limiting the work in progress at each stage of a
process. For example, in a software development scenario, you can limit the
number of features that are concurrently in development, or at QA, or waiting
to be activated in production. These limits create back-pressure in the system
and ensure the overall process doesn't wind up with a build up of items at one
stage in the process. Usually, this will help to identify constraints within a
system, but I like to use it for a different reason: to manage my sanity.

If I have a lot of plates all spinning at once, I tend to spend an appreciable
amount of time context switching between them, or working on the project that
isn't the most important thing right now, or just plain procrastinating because
I've got too much to do.

I also have a bad habit of not finishing projects, whether by putting the last
lick of paint on something, or actually getting a new feature into production,
or fixing that last wee bug, or redrafting and publishing a blog post, I
struggle to finish work. There are three reasons that I'm aware of in my psyche
for this:

* Interest. Once I've solved a problem in my head, it's, well, it's a solved
  problem, isn't it? Communicating the details of the solution, and
  transforming it into robust, working code that's fit for production is
  relatively dull. (I want minions to do my bidding!)

* Closure. Apparently, the Perceiving part of my INFP personality type doesn't
  like to be pushed into a corner, to make decisions, to close off other
  opportunities, to commit. I was a little sceptical of this, but I suppose I'm
  only moderately 'perceiving', and it does seem to fit, so...

* Fear. What if I deliver something as finished and it's *wrong* or *not good
  enough*? What if I'm ridiculed for it? What if people judge me (poorly) on
  the quality of what I've built? That's my version of perfectionism.

I need help to get projects across the finish line. So I'm playing around with
work-in-progress (WIP) limits. For each role in my life, I can only have so
many projects in current. The size of the project doesn't really matter -- I
can always pull another from the top of the backlog if I run out of projects in
current -- but I'm only allowed a fixed maximum of projects that are currently
active. In order to start on something new, I need to complete an existing
project, or make an active decision to drop/defer it.

The number of WIP projects varies depending on the role, but since I'm only one
person, I try to keep to a soft limit of two and a hard limit of three for each
role. (There's both a soft and a hard limit, so that I can accommodate
'emergencies' in each role.)

This is the one part of the system that so far is proving hard to keep to. I
have one particular client who is *way* further up the 'Perceiving' scale than
me, and I take on the balancing 'Judging' role there, frantically trying to
reduce the work in progress and drive things into production. But I have a hard
time taking on that role, so we do have ... one or two more projects in
progress than is strictly sensible.

## What's the next action?

This is all well and good. I have a trusted system which contains everything
that I currently think I would like to do. And it's organised in a manageable
way so as not to seem utterly daunting. How do I actually decide what to do
next?

There are, more often than I'd like, still tasks hanging over from yesterday
which I haven't completed for one reason or another. The first task is to
reassess them. Am I definitely going to do them today? In which case, I change
the start date to 'Today' and they become part of today's todo list. If not,
then I remove the start date entirely and allow them to be reassessed as part
of my regular review process.

Then it comes down to two things:

* Which role(s) am I fulfilling today? Which hat am I wearing today? I'll
  typically arrange my diary so that I'm dedicating full days to client work,
  and I normally work this out in advance for the month, so at work, I know
  which role I'm focusing on.

* What's current in that role's project list?

In the morning's planning session, I will take a set of actions that I think I
can accomplish today from those project(s), and I'll set their 'start date' to
being today. (Helpfully, OmniFocus lets you enter "Today" as a start time and
interprets it appropriately. More on that below.)

There are also other tasks. Things like posting letters, getting a haircut,
catching up with business finances, software maintenance, hardware maintenance,
remembering to take my dried frog pills. These tend to be reoccurring tasks, so
they show up automatically in today.

And there's usually one or two other little tasks that I'd like to get done
sometime through the day -- writing my NaNoWriMo words count, for example --
which get a start date of 'today'.

Now I have a list of items that I am committed to achieving today, and I have a
perspective in OmniFocus which shows me those items. However, it lacks some
order. Basically, the order in the list reflects the order of the projects in
the project tree of OmniFocus. This isn't necessarily optimal, and I've worked
around it a little by realising the start date is actually a time stamp. When
you order the perspective by start date, it will also order by start time.

Anything I've given a start date of 'Today' will get a start time of midnight
today and so will show up at the head of the list. I've exploited this to help
me roughly order my list of priorities for the day:

* Anything that I ought to think about before I go into work in the morning
  gets a start time of 6am. OmniFocus helpfully allows you to type in `6a`,
  which expands to `6am today`. Since I'm rarely up before 6am, these are
  usually when I'm scheduling in advance, so `6a tomorrow` gets them to show up
  at the appropriate time. Most often, these are recurring items ('remember to
  take your dried frog pills with breakfast').

* Anything that I need to deal with absolutely first thing when I get into the
  office (panicked emails from a client at 2am) gets a start time of 8am.

* Regular work for the day usually gets a start time of `9a`, but if I'm
  looking to order the list a bit more granularly, I'll play around with that a
  bit.

* Anything I'm looking to do at lunch time (errands, getting a haircut, posting
  letters) gets a start time of `12p`.

* Things that I want to do at the tail end of the day -- sometimes small tasks
  when I'm tired, or reviews -- get a time of `4p`.

* Finally, anything I want to do at home in the evening gets a time of `6p`.

There are a few advantages to this:

* My today view gets a semblance of order and of priority. I've got planning,
  urgent, general acting, lunch break things, review and evening tasks. I
  should be able to work through the list more or less in order.

* If the today view is daunting, I can switch to showing only 'available'
  tasks, which will hide the items that I don't intend to do until later in the
  day. They'll show up when they're available.

* When a new set of tasks becomes available, I'll get a Growl notification
  about it. This can help to remind me what stage of the day I'm at, if I've
  gotten lost in some code. (In other words, when the 6pm tasks show up as
  available and I'm not yet on a train home, I know my dinner is in the cat!)

## Trusted System

I hope this gives you an insight into how I operate my trusted system,
capturing, processing, organising and doing things.
