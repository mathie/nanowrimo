If only.

"A mouse? A fucking mouse? How can that little bastard be the scariest thing in
this wood?" The gruffalo stomped on a vole, crushing its tiny body under the
heel of his ferocious foot. It didn't make him feel any better, despite the
satisfying crunch. His mood really was as black as his tongue.

"I had him. A couple of slices of bread, a little brown sauce, and a little
brown mouse. I could have eaten him. My favourite food, too. How the hell did I
get outsmarted by my favourite food?"

All was quite in the deep, dark wood, save for the gruffalo beating a path back
home through the undergrowth. Then after a bit, the gruffalo heard a rustling
in the trees ahead. It was fox, with a sly grin on his face.

"Why hello", said fox, "he he. Did you just get your ass kicked by a mouse?
Seriously, I was ready for eating that wee shrimp, but I already had a lovely
lunch planned, and I didn't want to spoil my appetite. Not that the wee squirt
would have put me off my lunch much. There's so little meat on him, he'd hardly
count as a snack."

"You'd take on the mouse, would you?" said the gruffalo, trying to put on a
brave face. "I've seen him rip the entrails from an owl and wear them as a
souvenir."
