title: A week of cooking
excerpt: |
  We've been on holiday in the Northumbrian coast for the past ten days. I
  volunteered to be chef for the week. I really enjoy cooking, but between work
  and family constraints, I don't get the chance so often. I thought it would
  be fun to write up the week's cooking in the same style as Nigel Slater's
  Kitchen Diaries.

This week is a family holiday in the Northumbrian coast. I volunteered to be
chef for the week. I really enjoy cooking but between work and family
constraints I rarely get the opportunity, so I've been looking forward to the
opportunity. There have been six of us here all week -- the maternal
grandparents (afftectionately known as Mogie and Baba), Annabel, the two kids
and me. In addition, there have been various extra friends and family visiting
through the week.

We prefer the kids to eat with us, but if they're particularly tired (no nap
days for Emily!) or we wind up eating particularly late, they eat separately
and head to bed. Usually, it's leftovers from the previous day, but there's
always the fall-back option of pasta 'blobs' (ravioli or tortellini).

## Preparation

Since we're in a small, relatively remote, village, I figured that being
prepared was a good plan. I brainstormed a few recipe ideas, mostly repeats of
things I've cooked in the past 6 months, along with a couple of 'simple' meals
so I could skive off:

* Roast chicken for Sunday lunch, with the usual accoutrements of potatoes and
  veggies.

* A chilli con carne, using one of the kits from the Cool Chilli Company.

* Spinach and Ricotta Cannelloni. This started out as lasagne, but I fancied
  trying something a bit different, and I haven't made this for years.

* Fish pie. I'd made one recently for the same audience and it went down pretty
  well, so I thought I'd repeat it, varying a couple of things.

* Haggis, neeps and tatties. Always a good fall-back meal.

* Spaghetti bolognese.

* Boiled Ham in coca cola, with parsnip, potato and porcini gratin. I cooked
  this a few months back for a family Sunday dinner and they went together
  pretty well.

* Pumpkin risotto, mostly because we had pumpkins for carving (we're a bit
  behind schedule with celebrations this year -- I'm sure we'll be letting off
  fireworks in a week or two!) and it's a good way to use up the spare flesh.

With that, a couple of meals out and some leftovers, chances are we'll have
enough to keep us going for the time. Everyone seemed happy with the selection,
so it was just a case of placing an order online with Tesco for the ingredients
and having them delivered to the house shortly after we were scheduled to
arrive.

(This worked remarkably well. It was pretty straightforward to turn the ideas
into approximate recipes, then create a shopping list for the ingredients. And
the delivery turned up just after we'd arrived and unpacked, without any crazy
substitutions.)

## Friday, 1st November

Arriving, Joe, Charlie and Pete staying, kids eat past blobs, we have spaghetti
bolognese.

## Saturday, 2nd November

Joe, Charlie & Pete here, for the life of me, I can't remember what we had!

## Sunday, 3rd November

Joe & Charlie here for lunch before heading off; Pete heads off in the morning.
The roast chicken Sunday lunch.

## Monday, 4th November

Just the core family. I think today was Haggis, neeps & tatties with the whisky
sauce.

## Tuesday, 5th November

Just the core family. Today was fish pie.

## Wednesday, 6th November

Meal out at lunchtime, then snacking for dinner.

## Thursday, 7th November

Large family lunch out at Beadnell Towers with Judy, Alex, Kathy & Chris. Kathy
& Chris stayed over, and I made pumpkin risotto for supper.

## Friday, 8th November

Joe & Charlie return, and it's chilli con carne for dinner.

## Saturday, 9th November

Pancakes for breakfast? No idea what the rest of the plan is; I'm tempted to
suggest another meal out for lunch...

## Sunday, 10th November

And maybe boiled ham for lunch before we all leave?
